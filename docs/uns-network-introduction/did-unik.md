# Uns.network Decentralized IDentifiers

The main purpose of <brand name="uns"/> is to manage and to secure Decentralized IDentifiers (DID). Here we explain what is a DID in general and what are the specificities of the <brand name="uns"/> ones.

:::tip Reminder
**'UNIK'** is the name of the token representing a single @unikname ID within the uns.network blockchain. This is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). Every UNIK is a Decentralized IDentifier (DID).

## DID Remarkable properties

Any decentralized IDentifiers have remarkable properties which make them the legitimate successor of traditional identifiers:

- DID is under the sole control of his owner
- DID owner is the only one to decide who can access data related to its ID
- DID is available every time and everywhere around the world
- DID is immutable, once minted, it can't be modified nor deleted
- DID is unique on a global network, by definition
- DID lifetime is everlasting
- DID can be anonymous, and his use can be untraceable in a P2P context

**:heavy_check_mark:** <brand name="uns"/> UNIK DIDs have all these remarkable properties.

## DIDs only exist in a Decentralized Network

A Decentralized Network...
- relies on many independent actors from each other
- is publicly accessible
- has a decentralized governance, independent of a country (such as an international foundation)
- is reliable, resilient, incorruptible, resistant to censorship, efficient

…providing DID…
- is accessible at low cost
- provide « International IDs», not only latin nor ascii ones
- rewards securing and using DIDs
- guarantees the absolute sovereignty of IDs

…self-controls their creation.

**:heavy_check_mark:** <brand name="uns"/> meets all these criteria, making it the ideal Decentralized Network for DIDs

## What makes UNIK DID so unique?

**:heavy_check_mark:** DID UNIK is a **pseudonymous Identifer**, it is **not proof of digital identity**.  
**:heavy_check_mark:** DID UNIK is Human-Readable, easy to remember and **protected against typo-squatting**  
**:heavy_check_mark:** DID UNIK **belong to namespaces**, called types, defining their purpose.  
**:heavy_check_mark:** DID UNIK have **configurable governance rules** specific to their type.  
**:heavy_check_mark:** DID UNIK embed **exclusive features for authentication**  
**:heavy_check_mark:** DID UNIK have **advanced data registries** (on-chain, off-chain, encrypted, badges…)
