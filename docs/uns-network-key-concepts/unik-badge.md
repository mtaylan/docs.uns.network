# Understanding Badges

Each @unikname is assigned trust badges. They provide information on the qualities of each DID UNIK NFT and its involvement in the network.

<small>_example of badges displayed in the header section of @jack-sparrow_</small>

Badges take the form of On-Chain properties and are always Disclosed, regardless of the visibility of the UNIK.

The badges are accessible with the Resolver within the path "Badges/".

There are two types of badges, singular ones and enumerated ones, belonging to families.

The badges are returned by the APIs, the CLI, and are visible on the chain explorer and [on My Unikname App]().

The badges can be [claimed with the CLI](/uns-use-the-network/cli.html#badges-claim) and soon with [My Unikname App](/uns-network-unik-name-use-case/#my-unikname).

## Why Badges?

**Badges contribute to build trust in the network**.
They give indications on the quality and legitimacy of each @unikname.
