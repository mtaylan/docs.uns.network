# uns.network key concepts

:::information
Here we introduce key concepts of the UNS network. Those concepts are designed, but not all of them are implemented yet.
Please, wait a little bit more to try everything, and look at up right now what the future will be!
:::

## Cryptography Overview

:zap: [Cryptography within uns.network blockchain](/key-concept/cryptography-overview)
<hbox>In the blockchain world you must rely on cryptography to make it happends! <brand name="uns"/> cryptography is based on ARK.IO basics augmented with specificities related to Decentralized IDs and Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure requirements.</hbox>

## IDs rooted in the uns.network blockchain

:zap: [UNIK Identifiers](/key-concept/unik-did-nft)
<hbox>What is a Decentralized IDentifier in general and what are the specificities of the uns.network ones: the UNIK Identifiers.</hbox>

:zap: [Types of UNIK DIDs](/key-concept/unik-type)
<hbox>UNIK DIDs are minted with a type according to their purpose.</hbox>

:zap: [Pattern of @unikname IDs](/key-concept/unik-pattern)
<hbox>The way the character string forming a @unikname ID is combined can be classified into patterns. Patterns are used to determine the cost of @unikname ID and to control @unikname issuance.</hbox>

:zap: [UNIK Badges](/key-concept/unik-badge)
<hbox>Every UNIK DIDs are featured with trust badges.</hbox>

:zap: [UNIK Life Cycle Status](/key-concept/unik-lifecycle)
<hbox>The life cycle status provides information on the state of a UNIK and allows to know whether the UNIK is active or not.</hbox>

:zap: [UNIK properties](/key-concept/unik-property)
<hbox>UNIK owners can define customized properties to their IDs.</hbox>

## Network Services

:zap: [Network Service Providers](/key-concept/service-provider)

:zap: [Directory Of Network UniT Services (DONUTS)](/key-concept/donuts)


## Network Governance

:zap: [Understanding Governance of uns.network blockchain](/key-concept/network-governance)
<hbox>The uns.network is a DPoS blockchain governed by three separates colleges of stakeholders.</hbox>
